## FloodPredAI: Flood Risk Assessment Model

## Problem Statement
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of flooding, a major global humanitarian and economic threat.
Traditional flood modeling methods are often slow and computationally expensive. 
This project explores the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) to create a faster,
more accessible predictive model for flood risk based on key environmental indicators like rainfall and river levels.

## Overview
This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for building a flood prediction model from scratch. Developed over a 3-week internship, this project demonstrates the fundamentals of data science and machine learning, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and saving.

## Tech Stack
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
*   **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## Key Steps & Methodology
1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sourced hydrological data from Kaggle.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and split the data into training/testing sets.
